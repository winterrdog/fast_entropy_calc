# fast_entropy_calc
Calculates the Shannon entropy of the provided file.

## Usage
- Clone the repository using `git`:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/winterrdog/fast_entropy_calc.git
    ```
- Run `make` in the project's root directory in order to compile it:
    ```sh
    cd fast_entropy_calc
    make
    ```
- Then run it:
    ```sh
    ./get_entropy
    ```

## NOTE
- Currently works on `unix` systems __only__ provided there's `g++` on the system

## TODO
- Add `clang` support
- Add `mingw` support
- Calculate entropy for multiple files

## Contributions
* The project's always open to suggestions and contributions( also _criticism_ ).
